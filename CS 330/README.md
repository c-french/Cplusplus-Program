# How do I approach designing software?
## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this project gave me a great deal of insight on what goes into creating 3D graphics in an application, from positioning texture locations to configuring buffer objects do send data to the computer's GPU.
## What design process did you follow for your project work?
There was a lot of trial and error that went into this project.  Whenever an issue arose such as vertices not drawing correctly or a texture wasnt loading, I would both check my code for errors and consult online resources like OpenGL documentation or StackExchange to try to resolve the given issue.
## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Trial and error, checking to see if other have had the same issue, and checking back with the official API documentation will likely be a permanent part of designing programs moving forward. It's one of the most efficient ways of improving code that I know of.

# How do I approach developing programs?
## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The newest development strategy I used to work on this project was to use a previously used solution file as a template.  It saved me the effort of setting up linker libraries for the additional dependencies required by OpenGL, and I can see this method being used on other future efforts that utilize other custom libraries.
## How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was an important factor for work done between the milestones of the course that culminated with this project.  Working bit by bit helped make the work reasonable to tackle in the given time frame, and focusing on one part at a time helped keep the project as a whole from feeling overwhelming.
## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
One milestone's completed work would be the next one's start.  Along the way some refactoring would occur, such as grouping vertex array data, or moving redundant code such as for generating vertex array objects or textures into a function call.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations have given me the capability to render 3D graphics, which will help should I need to create visualizations for programs in other classes.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations have given me the capability to render a 3D environment, which could be useful in most modern programs, especially should I go on to create a video game or similar program.
