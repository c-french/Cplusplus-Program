## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course, the main problem to solve was to find the most effient way to organise a given list of data.  Depending on the method used, processing time could vary anywhere from almost instantaneously to closer to a minute to finish.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

After completing the analysis, the two structures that stood above the rest were the hashtable and the binary tree. I chose to implement the binary tree, as it was the fastest in the analysis.  I also made the assumption that the data it would process would be in a fairly random order, which fortunately was correct in this case. 

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The largest roadblock I had was with developing the CSV parsing component, specifically how to handle the cases of where some courses had no prerequisites.  However, after browing some tutorials and some trial and error, I was able to come up with a good solution.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Prior to taking this course, I had never known about different data structures.  Knowing what I know now, though, I can make better choices in how to handle large amounts of data and determine the most efficient way to process it.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

By learning the standard pattern of the data structures covered over the course (array, hashtable, tree), and learning commonly used algorithms to handle the processing of data in these structures, this helps me create cleaner code for others to come back to, improving readability and maintainability.  By having an understanding of these data structures, it is easy to insert them into the program as needed, only needing to change small parts like how it interprets incoming data(a CSV file, a standard text file, a webpage, etc.) making the code adaptable as well.
