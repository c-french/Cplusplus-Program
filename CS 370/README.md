<h1>Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
<h3>On this project I was given code that set up the game environment for an 8 x 8 grid based game where a pirate agent must navigate around blocked squares to find the treasure square.  the code for the reward system was provided as well.  I created the code for the agent incorporating these given pieces so that it followed a deep Q learning system.  Once the AI reached a 100% win rate the training epochs would stop, posting results to the console.

<h2>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
<h3>A computer scientist solves large problems by breaking them down into smaller pieces and implementing those pieces to build a solution.  Its an important task because it simplifies approaches towards tackling larger problems that may otherwise be unable to be implemented.  By tackling a problem piece by piece, complicated tasks such as machine learning can be completed.

<h2>How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
<h3>I approach problems by looking at the task as a whole, then figuring out what each piece to the problem is.  I then take each piece and implement a solution in code, testing the solution along the way.  Once each piece is finished and tested, the problem is solved.

<h2>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
<h3>Ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization involve proper handling of data.  Data from either side should be protected and not taken if the given party requests as such.  In the context of machine learning, responsibilities include removing the possibility of hidden bias, ensuring a fair and working solution for the user.
