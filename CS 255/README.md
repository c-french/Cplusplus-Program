## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

In this project, the client, DriverPass, wanted to create a system to prepare upcoming drivers for their tests.  This system features an online platform for students to schedule appointments with drivers for lessons, read posted feedback from previous appointments, and take online tests.  Further, it allowed administrator users to update the content of the online tests, reset user passwords, and view and print activity logs.

## What did you do particularly well?

I feel I did well at outlining the necessary proceses for the user to have all the capabilities outlined by the client.   I also feel like the class diagrams came out well.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I could likely improve by showing some items that the system generates, such as the activities for the log reports.  Looking back, that was an aspect that I took for granted.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs were the cornerstone of this project, as it was through these needs that I was able to come up with the needed proceses to handle everything.  User needs are important because they are ultimately the customers for the product you are designing.  If you don't implement all, or at least most, when "all" isn't feasible, of the needs for the user, the users percieve it as a poor product.  If you produce poor products, your userbase will begin to shop elsewhere.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach design with a task oriented method.  I make a list of everything the software needs to do to function, and go down the list in the most logical order, testing as each feature is created.  Granted, as of yet I haven't created anything grander than a few hundred lines of code.  With bigger systems to implement, I would certainly utilize uml diagrams, especially class diagrams, to keep track of everything and give me a good roadmap of what needs to be done and how to do it.
